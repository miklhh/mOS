-----     Coding guidlines.     -----
1. Code shall always be written with the goal of being self explanatory.
   Comments should complement code where it is hard to write code in such a way
   and comment shall be written in such a way that it does not bloat the code or
   disturb the flow of the code.



-----     Style guide rules.     -----
1. All source code files must have a maximum line width of 80 characters.
       Clarification:   Code with longer line width than 80 characters violates 
                        this rule and is not premitted.
       Exceptions:      A single whitespace character can be used in column 81.
                        Comments whom otherwise would harm readability if moved
                        elsewhere.
                        

2. No comments that does not complement the code.
       Clarification:   Comments that 'states the obvious' are not premitted.
       Exceptions:      None.
